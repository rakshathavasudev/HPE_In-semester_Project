Landsat 8 level 1T products are downloaded from https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ with 90% removed cloud coverage.

Since the scenes we used in this project are of 20GB, we are not able to put them here.

Data obtained after converting to time series i.e. indices values are stored in the text files in this directory.
